## What is DBMS?

`Database Management Systems (DBMS) are software systems used to store, retrieve, and run queries on data.`

It is of two types:

- `Relational (SQL)`
    
    A relational database is a collection of data items with pre-defined relationships between them, stored in the form of tables, rows, and columns.

    Examples: MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL.

- `Non-Relational (No-SQL)`

    NoSQL databases are non-relational, offering flexible schemas, scalability, and support for diverse data models. Commonly used in web development, analytics, and content management for handling large and dynamic data.
    
    Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis.
