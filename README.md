# ‚òòÔ∏è Introduction

## What is a database?
    
`A database is an organized collection of structured information or data.`

## What is DBMS?

`Database Management Systems (DBMS) are software systems used to store, retrieve, and run queries on data.`

It is of two types:

- `Relational (SQL)`
    
    A relational database is a collection of data items with pre-defined relationships between them, stored in the form of tables, rows, and columns.

    Examples: MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL.

- `Non-Relational (No-SQL)`

    NoSQL databases are non-relational, offering flexible schemas, scalability, and support for diverse data models. Commonly used in web development, analytics, and content management for handling large and dynamic data.
    
    Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis.

## What is MySQL?

`MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Oracle i.e. based on structured query language (SQL).`

# ‚òòÔ∏è Database-Table

## What is a database table?
`A database table is a collection of rows and columns that contains relational data.`

# ‚òòÔ∏è Inserting-Data

## Inserting Single Row

    Syntax:

        INSERT INTO table_name 
        (column1, column2, column3, ...)
        VALUES 
        (value1, value2, value3, ...);

# ‚òòÔ∏è Select-And-Where

## SELECT Statement

`In MySQL, you use the SELECT statement to retrieve data from one or more tables. `

    Syntax:

        SELECT column1, column2, ...
        FROM table_name;

    Example:

        SELECT name, email
        FROM users;


    If you want to select all columns from a table, you can use the wildcard *

    Syntax:

        SELECT *
        FROM table_name;

    Example:

        SELECT *
        FROM users;

## WHERE Clause

`The WHERE clause is used to filter records.`

`It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.`

    Syntax:

        SELECT column1, column2, ...
        FROM table_name
        WHERE condition

    Example:
        
        SELECT id, name, email
        FROM users
        WHERE gender = 'M' AND status = 1;

## WHERE Conditions

`In SQL, the WHERE clause is used to filter the rows returned by a query based on specified conditions. Here are common conditions that can be used in conjunction with the WHERE clause:`

1. **Equality (`=`):**
   - Used to filter rows where a specified column is equal to a specific value.
   - Example: `WHERE column_name = value;`

2. **Inequality (`!=` or `<>`):**
   - Used to filter rows where a specified column is not equal to a specific value.
   - Example: `WHERE column_name <> value;`

3. **Comparison Operators (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`):**
   - Used to filter rows based on numerical or date comparisons.
   - Example: `WHERE column_name > value;`

4. **LIKE Operator:**
   - Used to perform pattern matching with wildcard characters (`%` for any sequence of characters, `_` for a single character).
   - Example: `WHERE column_name LIKE 'pattern';`

5. **BETWEEN Operator:**
   - Used to filter rows within a specified range.
   - Example: `WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;`

6. **IN Operator:**
   - Used to filter rows where a column matches any value in a specified list.
   - Example: `WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);`

7. **IS NULL and IS NOT NULL:**
   - Used to filter rows where a column is (or is not) NULL.
   - Example: `WHERE column_name IS NULL;`

8. **Logical Operators (AND, OR, NOT):**
   - Used to combine multiple conditions.
   - Example: `WHERE condition1 AND condition2;`

9. **EXISTS Operator:**
   - Used to check if a subquery returns any results.
   - Example: `WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM another_table WHERE condition);`

10. **ANY and ALL Operators:**
    - Used with subqueries for comparing values.
    - Example: `WHERE column_name > ANY (SELECT column_name FROM another_table);`

## ALIAS

`In SQL, an alias is a temporary name. It is used to provide a more readable or meaningful name to a table or column, especially when dealing with complex queries or when working with the result of a query.`

There are two main types of aliases:

1. **Table Alias:**
   - Used to give a table a temporary, alternative name in a query.

   - Syntax:
     
            SELECT column1, column2, ...
            FROM table_name AS alias_name
            WHERE condition;
     
   - Example:
     
            SELECT name, id
            FROM users AS Active_Users
            WHERE status = 1;

2. **Column Alias:**
   - Used to assign a temporary name to a column in the result set.
   
   - Syntax:
     
            SELECT column_name AS alias_name, ...
            FROM table_name
            WHERE condition;
            
   - Example:
     
            SELECT name AS E_Name, id AS U_ID
            FROM users 
            WHERE status = 1;
     
# ‚òòÔ∏è Constraints

## Table without Constraints üëá

![Screenshot (2661)-1](https://github.com/k-sameer701/Learn-SQL/assets/103239208/2ffa2d83-07c7-4a09-9603-86e0e1d516cb)


In MySQL, table constraints are rules or conditions applied to the columns in a table to maintain the integrity, accuracy, and relationships of the data. 
They are specified during the table creation using the `CREATE TABLE` statement. Constraints can also be added or modified later using the `ALTER TABLE` statement.

1. **PRIMARY KEY Constraint:**
   - Ensures that a column or a combination of columns uniquely identifies each row in the table.
   - Example:
     
            CREATE TABLE employees (
                employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
                first_name VARCHAR(50),
                last_name VARCHAR(50)
            );

            

2. **FOREIGN KEY Constraint:**
   - Establishes a link between two tables, enforcing referential integrity.
   - Example:
     
            CREATE TABLE orders (
                order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
                customer_id INT,
                FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
            );
            

3. **UNIQUE Constraint:**
   - Ensures that all values in a column (or a combination of columns) are unique.
   - Example:
     
            CREATE TABLE products (
                product_name VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
                price DECIMAL(10, 2)
            );

            

4. **CHECK Constraint:**
   - Specifies a condition that must be satisfied for each row in the table.
   - Example:
     
            CREATE TABLE employees (
                employee_id INT,
                salary DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (salary >= 0)
            );
            

5. **DEFAULT Constraint:**
   - Provides a default value for a column if no value is specified during an INSERT operation.
   - Example:
     
            CREATE TABLE students
            (
                id INT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
                name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
                email VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
                age TINYINT CHECK (age >= 18),
                status BOOLEAN DEFAULT 1
            );
            

6. **NOT NULL Constraint:**
   - Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value.
   - Example:
     
            CREATE TABLE orders (
                order_id INT,
                order_date DATE NOT NULL
            );


# ‚òòÔ∏è AND-OR-NOT

1. **AND Operator:**
   - The `AND` operator is used to retrieve rows that satisfy multiple conditions simultaneously.

   - Example: Retrieve students who are both active (`status = 1`) and have an age greater than or equal to 20.
     
            SELECT * 
            FROM students 
            WHERE status = 1 AND age >= 20;
     

2. **OR Operator:**
   - The `OR` operator is used to retrieve rows that satisfy at least one of multiple conditions.

   - Example: Retrieve students who are either inactive (`status = 0`) or have an age less than 18.
   
          SELECT * 
          FROM students 
          WHERE status = 0 OR age < 18;
     

3. **NOT Operator:**
   - The `NOT` operator is used to negate a condition, retrieving rows that do not satisfy a particular condition.
   - Example: Retrieve students who are not active (`status = 0`).
     
            SELECT * 
            FROM students 
            WHERE NOT status = 0;

# ‚òòÔ∏è In-Operator

## IN Operator

`The SQL IN operator is used to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause for a SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, or INSERT statement. It is typically used to reduce the use of multiple OR conditions in a query.`

    Syntax:

        SELECT column1, column2, ...
        FROM table_name
        WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);


- `column1, column2, ...`: The columns you want to retrieve in the SELECT statement.
- `table_name`: The name of the table from which to retrieve the data.
- `column_name`: The column against which you want to compare values.
- `(value1, value2, ...)`: The list of values to compare with the specified column.

    Example:

        SELECT *
        FROM students
        WHERE age IN (19,20);

# ‚òòÔ∏è LIKE-Operator

## LIKE Operator

The LIKE Operator is used in a WHERE Clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

- The percent sign (%) represents zero, one, or multiple characters.
- The underscore sign (_) represents one, single character.

    Syntax:

        SELECT column1, column2, ...
        FROM table_name
        WHERE column_name LIKE pattern;

    Example:

        SELECT name
        FROM students
        WHERE name LIKE "a%";

## Patterns

    'a%'    :   Starts with "a".
    '%a'    :   End with "a".
    '%or%'  :   Have "or" in any position.
    '_r%'   :   Have "r" in the second position.
    'a_%'   :   Starts with "a" and are at least 2 characters in length (including a).
    'a__%'  :   Starts with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length (including a).
    'a%o'   :   Starts with "a" and ends with "o".


# ‚òòÔ∏è Between-NOT-Between

## BETWEEN & NOT BETWEEN

`The BETWEEN and NOT BETWEEN operators in SQL are used to filter the result set based on a range of values. These operators are typically used in the WHERE clause of a SQL query.`

    Syntax (BETEEN):

        SELECT column1, column2, ...
        FROM table_name
        WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;

    Example:

        SELECT *
        FROM students
        WHERE age BETWEEN 20 AND 30;

    Syntax (NOT BETWEEN):

        SELECT column1, column2, ...
        FROM table_name
        WHERE column_name NOT BETWEEN value1 AND value2;

    Example:

        SELECT *
        FROM students
        WHERE age NOT BETWEEN 20 AND 30;

# ‚òòÔ∏è Order-By-And-Distinct

## ORDER BY

`The ORDER BY clause in SQL is used to sort the result set of a query based on one or more columns. It is typically used at the end of a SELECT statement.`

`Remember that you can sort in ascending order (ASC) or descending order (DESC). If you don't specify the order, ASC is assumed by default. `

    Syntax:

        SELECT column1, column2, ...
        FROM table_name
        WHERE condition
        ORDER BY column1 [ASC | DESC], column2 [ASC | DESC], ...;

    Example :

        SELECT id, name, age, status
        FROM students
        ORDER BY age ASC;

## DISTINCT

`The DISTINCT keyword in SQL is used in a SELECT statement to eliminate duplicate rows from the result set. It returns only unique values for the specified columns.`

    Syntax:

        SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
        FROM table_name
        WHERE condition;

    Example:

        SELECT DISTINCT status
        FROM students;

# ‚òòÔ∏è Is-Null-And-Is-Not-Null

## IS NULL

`The IS NULL operator is used to filter rows where a specified column contains a null value.`

    Syntax:
        SELECT column1, column2, ...
        FROM table_name
        WHERE column_name IS NULL;

    Example:
        SELECT *
        FROM students
        WHERE age IS NULL;


## IS NOT NULL

`The IS NOT NULL operator is used to filter rows where a specified column does not contain a null value.`

    Syntax:

        SELECT column1, column2, ...
        FROM table_name
        WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;

    Example:

        SELECT *
        FROM students
        WHERE age IS NOT NULL;

# ‚òòÔ∏è Limit-And-Offset

## LIMIT

`If want to LIMIT, the number of results that are returned you can simply use the LIMIT command with several rows to LIMIT by.`

    Syntax:

        SELECT *
        FROM table_name
        LIMIT number_to_limit_by;

    Example:

        SELECT *
        FROM students
        LIMIT 3;

## OFFSET

`You can also specify an OFFSET from where to start returning the Data.`

    Syntax:

        SELECT *
        FROM table_name
        LIMIT number_to_limit_by OFFSET number_of_rows_to_skip;

    Example:

        SELECT *
        FROM students
        LIMIT 3 OFFSET 2;

# ‚òòÔ∏è Aggregate-Functions

## AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS

`In MySQL, aggregate functions are used to perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value.`

Here are some common aggregate functions in MySQL:

1. **COUNT():**
   - Counts the number of rows in a result set.
    
    Syntax:
    
        SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;


2. **SUM():**
   - Calculates the sum of values in a numeric column.
    
    Syntax:
        
        SELECT SUM(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
   

3. **AVG():**
   - Calculates the average of values in a numeric column.

    Syntax:
        
        SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
   

4. **MIN():**
   - Finds the minimum value in a column.

    Syntax:
    
        SELECT MIN(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
   

5. **MAX():**
   - Finds the maximum value in a column.
   
    Syntax:
    
        SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
   

    Example:

        SELECT
        SUM() AS total_sales,
        AVG(sale_amount) AS average_sale,
        COUNT(order_id) AS order_count
        FROM sales
        WHERE sale_date >= '2022-01-01';
